      title: "Gemma Baseline Analysis - Comparison Experiment"
      description: |
        This analysis is part of our comprehensive comparison study evaluating different language models
        on tabular data reasoning tasks. This specific analysis focuses on Gemma-7B,
        Google's open-source language model family, optimized for efficiency and
        performance across various reasoning tasks.
        
        This baseline experiment uses the standard configuration with 3 few-shot examples,
        no chain-of-thought reasoning, and header-5 observation mode. The results will be
        compared against other model variants to understand the impact of model architecture
        on tabular data reasoning performance.
