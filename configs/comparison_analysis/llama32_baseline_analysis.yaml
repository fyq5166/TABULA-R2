      title: "Llama3.2 Baseline Analysis - Comparison Experiment"
      description: |
        This analysis is part of our comprehensive comparison study evaluating different language models
        on tabular data reasoning tasks. This specific analysis focuses on Llama3.2-Latest,
        representing the latest iteration of Meta's Llama model series with improved
        reasoning capabilities and instruction following.
        
        This baseline experiment uses the standard configuration with 3 few-shot examples,
        no chain-of-thought reasoning, and header-5 observation mode. The results will be
        compared against other model variants to understand the impact of model architecture
        on tabular data reasoning performance.
