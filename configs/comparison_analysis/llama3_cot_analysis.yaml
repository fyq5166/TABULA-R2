      title: "Llama3 Chain-of-Thought Analysis - Comparison Experiment"
      description: |
        This analysis is part of our comprehensive comparison study evaluating different language models
        on tabular data reasoning tasks. This specific analysis focuses on Llama3 with chain-of-thought (CoT)
        reasoning enabled, testing whether explicit step-by-step reasoning improves the model's ability
        to generate correct DSL expressions and reason about complex tabular data relationships.
        
        This experiment uses the standard configuration with 3 few-shot examples,
        chain-of-thought reasoning enabled, and header-5 observation mode. The results will be
        compared against other reasoning variants to understand the impact of explicit reasoning
        on tabular data reasoning performance.
