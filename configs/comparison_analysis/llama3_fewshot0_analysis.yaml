      title: "Llama3 Few-shot=0 Analysis - Comparison Experiment"
      description: |
        This analysis is part of our comprehensive comparison study evaluating different language models
        on tabular data reasoning tasks. This specific analysis focuses on Llama3 with zero few-shot examples,
        testing the model's ability to perform tabular reasoning without any demonstration examples,
        relying purely on its pre-trained knowledge and instruction following capabilities.
        
        This experiment uses the standard configuration with 0 few-shot examples,
        no chain-of-thought reasoning, and header-5 observation mode. The results will be
        compared against other few-shot variants to understand the impact of demonstration examples
        on tabular data reasoning performance.
