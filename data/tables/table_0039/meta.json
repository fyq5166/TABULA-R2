  "description": "The data sourced from Chris Goodall's book is representative of the composition of the average carbon footprint in the United Kingdom at the time of writing (reprinted in 2011). Significant variability between individual lifestyles in the UK, and across comparable high-income countries is to be expected. This breakdown does not include estimates of per capita contribution to national services, manufacturing and infrastructure; Goodall estimated this additional component to comprise approximately 35% of an individual's footprint.",
