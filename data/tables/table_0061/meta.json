This measures cancer deaths across both sexes and all ages.\r\n\r\nSmaller categories of cancer types have been grouped by Our World in Data into a collective category 'Other cancers'. This grouping was set based on cancer types with global annual deaths in 2016 under 100,000. This includes testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, mesothelioma, thyroid, non-melanoma skin cancer, nasopharynx, malignant skin melanoma, uterine cancer, and multiple myeloma.",
