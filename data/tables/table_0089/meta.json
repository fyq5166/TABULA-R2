  "description": "The number of children that survived past 5 years of age per women is calculated by multiplying the child survival rate by the fertility rate of a country for a given year.\n\nChild survival rate is 1 minus the child mortality rate. The dataset comes from version 10 of Gapminder, the latest version as of 2019. \n\nTotal fertility rate represents the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific fertility rates of the specified year. The dataset comes from version 12 of Gapminder, the latest version as of 2019.",
