### Example: ex_agg_0002
Question:
What is the average Y in Country B from 2000 to 2010?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Filter to Country B and Year in range
2) Compute mean of Y

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load(table_T)
filter_all(Entity == "Country B"; Year >= 2000; Year <= 2010)
select("Y")
groupby().agg({mean: "Y"})
END PLAN
