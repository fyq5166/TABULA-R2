### Example: ex_agg_0003
Question:
What is the total Z by Region in 2010 after joining table_A and table_B?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Load A, B; filter to Year==2010
2) Join on (Entity, Year); groupby Region and sum Z

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load_as(table_A, A)
load_as(table_B, B)
filter_all(Year == 2010)
join(A, B, on=[Entity, Year], how=inner)
groupby(Region).agg({sum: "Z"})
END PLAN
