### Example: ex_agg_0004
Question:
What is the total number of deaths from heart disease and cancer combined in the United States in 1950?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Filter to United States and Year 1950
2) Select heart disease and cancer death columns
3) Calculate sum of both columns
4) I have the answer, so output END

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load(table_0001)
filter_all(Entity == "United States"; Year == 1950)
select("Heart disease - Deaths", "Cancers - Deaths")
derive(total_deaths = "Heart disease - Deaths" + "Cancers - Deaths")
select(total_deaths)
END PLAN

---- Next turn: I have the result, so output END ----
END:
746438
END
