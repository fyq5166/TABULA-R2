### Example: ex_cmp_0001
Question:
Which entity has the highest value of M in 2015?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Filter to Year==2015; order by M desc; take first entity

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load(table_T)
filter(Year == 2015)
order(M, ascending=False)
limit(1)
select(Entity)
END PLAN
