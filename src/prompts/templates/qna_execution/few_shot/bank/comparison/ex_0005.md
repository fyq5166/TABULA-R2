### Example: ex_cmp_0002
Question:
What is the year-over-year change in N for Country C from 2010 to 2011?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Filter to Country C and Years 2010, 2011; compute difference N_2011 - N_2010

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load(table_T)
filter_any(Year == 2010; Year == 2011)
filter(Entity == "Country C")
select(Year, "N")
order(Year, ascending=True)
derive(diff = "N" - lag("N"))
limit(1)
select(diff)
END PLAN
