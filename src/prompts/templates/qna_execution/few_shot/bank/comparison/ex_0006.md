### Example: ex_cmp_0003
Question:
Between Entity A and Entity B, which has the greater value of Q in 2012 after joining tables?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Load table_A and table_B; join if needed to access Q
2) Filter to Year==2012 and entities of interest; order and pick max

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load_as(table_A, A)
load_as(table_B, B)
join(A, B, on=[Entity, Year], how=inner)
filter_any(Entity == "Entity A"; Entity == "Entity B")
filter(Year == 2012)
order(Q, ascending=False)
limit(1)
select(Entity)
END PLAN
