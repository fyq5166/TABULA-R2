### Example: ex_flt_0002
Question:
Is there any record for Country F in 1999?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Filter to entity/year; check existence by limiting to 1 row

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load(table_T)
filter_all(Entity == "Country F"; Year == 1999)
limit(1)
select(Entity)
END PLAN
