### Example: ex_rel_0001
Question:
After joining table_A and table_B on (Entity, Year), what is the sum of R for 2015?

{% if include_cot %}
Reasoning:
1) Load A, B; join on keys; filter to 2015; sum R

{% endif %}
---- Output (emit exactly one block) ----
PLAN
load_as(table_A, A)
load_as(table_B, B)
join(A, B, on=[Entity, Year], how=inner)
filter(Year == 2015)
groupby().agg({sum: "R"})
END PLAN
